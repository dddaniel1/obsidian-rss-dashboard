## Unreleased

### Features

- Added on-demand full-text loading with Mozilla Readability: when full article content cannot be displayed (truncated RSS excerpts, paywalls, or failed extraction), users can click the "Load full text" button in the inline banner or the reader toolbar action ("Load full article") to fetch and extract clean full content with fallback selectors and relative link/image resolution directly in both the Reader view and Dashboard inline reader.

- Added a reader translation service with Microsoft and Google providers and an immersive-style bilingual display: translated paragraphs appear directly under the originals in the reader, toggled by a header button, configurable in Settings > Display > Translation.

- Added Local / FreshRSS selection in the existing dashboard, sharing its sidebar, article list, and reader while keeping local subscriptions separate from synchronized data.

- Added a paged podcast playlist that renders a five-episode window around the active episode, with order-relative browsing controls, a return-to-current action for large feeds, and placeholder-first artwork loading that avoids empty or broken-image boxes. This should alleviate performance issues for feeds with many episodes. [GH Issue #183](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/183)
- Added opt-in local caching for Dashboard Card and Feed preview images, with a 1 MiB per-image limit, a synchronized 1–1024 MiB slider/input or unlimited aggregate cap, cache management controls, remote-image fallback, cache warming after feed additions and OPML/background imports, protection against refreshes overwriting Discover feeds that are still hydrating, and automatic cache cleanup when all feeds are deleted. [GH Issue #177](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/177)
- Added a Stop button on the All feeds sidebar row during global refreshes, allowing users to cancel an in-progress refresh, including when only one eligible feed remains. Cancelled feeds do not advance their refresh timestamps, and in-progress fetches are aborted via an AbortSignal. Failed-feed retries and folder/selected/tag/due refreshes remain non-cancellable. [GH Issue #173](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/173)
- Added Shift+click and an All feeds context-menu action to retry failed, non-excluded feeds without advancing the global refresh timestamp. [GH Issue #168](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/168)
- Added static refresh-status timestamps and accessible refresh details for all feeds, folders, and feeds. [GH Issue #167](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/167)
- New installations now default global feed auto-refresh to Off.
- Added automatic and per-feed Windows-1251 decoding for RSS/Atom feeds, including preview and refresh support. New dropdown available in the add/edit feed window > Feed options > Feed Encoding [GH Issue #155](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/155)
- Added a saved-template selector when saving articles to a custom folder, including immediate selection of newly created templates and viewable templates via Article Savings tab. [GH Issue #158](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/158)
- Added a new **Settings > Display > Dashboard** option to choose whether pagination controls appear at the top or bottom of the page, with bottom as the default. [GH Issue #161](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/161)
- Added formula-aware selection in Reader views: rendered LaTeX is visibly highlighted and copies as its retained source while preserving surrounding article text.

### Fixes

- Fixed FreshRSS-synchronized podcast and video feeds being shown as plain articles by keeping media enclosures and marking those items as podcast or video so the reader renders the built-in players.
- Fixed dashboard header Mark all read/unread controls so they update and persist the stored articles in the current filtered view. [GH Issue #185](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/185)
- Removed duplicate close controls from mobile Dashboard and Discover sidebars, retaining Obsidian's standard modal header close button.
- Standardized sidebar and mobile navigation scrolling on native Obsidian scrollbars, removing the retired scrollbar-visibility preference and custom scrollbar styling in order to improve Community Plugin compliance score.
- Fixed OPML imports and Discover Add actions so their feed fetching uses the global sidebar spinner and Stop action, cancels active and queued work, preserves completed results, and ignores late results after cancellation. [GH Issue #179](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/179)
- Fixed dashboard Card and Feed preview settings so cover images and summaries can be controlled independently, cover-only cards retain their image on hover, and disabling cover images avoids dashboard preview-image loading. [GH Issue #175](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/175)
- Fixed sidebar icon visibility settings displaying `[object DocumentFragment]` instead of each icon's name.
- Fixed the All feeds refresh-details popup showing alongside Obsidian's delayed native tooltip. [GH Issue #168](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/168)
- Fixed refresh-detail tooltip and ghost-popup regressions, and prevented global-refresh vault saves from reloading empty article shards. [GH Issue #167](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/167)
- Fixed per-feed auto-refresh intervals so Use global, Off, and custom schedules control runtime refresh timing. Failed attempts now wait their configured interval without changing the last successful update time. [GH Issue #166](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/166)
- Fixed low-resolution fallback hero images being stretched across the Reader by preserving their intrinsic width, centering them, and only scaling them down when needed to fit the available space.
- Fixed article saves failing on Windows when long titles produced filenames that exceeded safe path lengths by truncating generated filenames to 100 characters while preserving the full title in the note content. [GH Issue #157](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/157)
- Fix: Math formulas from Math StackExchange feeds now render in Reader content and dashboard title cards through the Markdown renderer lifecycle path, with a small in-memory cache for reopen performance. Full implementation notes are archived in [math rendering investigation](docs/archive/investigations/2026/math-rendering.md). [GH Issue #162](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/162)
- Fixed WordPress LaTeX image formulas being promoted and stretched as article covers. Their embedded TeX now renders as native, theme-aware math in Reader views and is saved with Obsidian-compatible math delimiters, with the original image retained as a render-failure fallback while later article photos remain eligible as covers and heroes.
- Fix: Allow `vault-shards-v2` as a valid storage mode when importing portable data bundles to resolve the "invalid Storagemode value" error.
- Fix: Dashboard and sidebar views now correctly sync their settings reference from the plugin on every refresh, ensuring feed lists and sidebar folders rebuild correctly after cross-device sync delivers new data.
- Fix: Hitting "enter" after inputing a url in the add feed modal now correctly loads the feed instead of advancing to 'Title' input box.

### Development and compliance

- Established a documented idea-to-release plan lifecycle: pre-issue work uses dated draft names, accepted implementation work receives a permanent GitHub issue-number filename, milestones distinguish Required and Stretch release scope, active plans remain in `docs/plans/`, validated implementations move to the indexed `docs/archive/plans/unreleased/` area, and release cuts group them under `v<version>` with metadata, links, and catalog entries updated during handoff.
- Added a repository-local workflow for GitHub issues and feature requests that accepts a supplied issue summary before fetching its URL, preserves exact issue links in changelog entries, applies risk-based Obsidian audit and validation gates, and consolidates public release notes under `docs/releases/` when a release is prepared.
- Strengthened the Obsidian audit baseline by upgrading `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` from 0.1.9 to 0.4.1, enabling its recommended production checks, migrating remaining DOM construction to popout-safe owning-window helpers, and adding shared jsdom coverage for those runtime APIs.
- Enforced a zero-`!important` CSS policy with a repository check and regression tests, and aligned contributor instructions, pull-request guidance, compliance documentation, design guidance, and the plugin scorecard with the stricter policy.

## 2.5.0 - July 11, 2026

### Features

- Added a storage migration pop up on plugin update to encourage users to upgrade to the latest storage mode.

### Fixes

- Fix: shard local storage address not correctly appearing in edit feed window
- Fix: Scrolling not working on mobile Discover sidebar
- Fix: clicking the tag icon on cards a second time will now close the window instead of re-opening it

### Audit remediations

- Fixed: Unexpected browser feature 'multicolumn' is only partially supported by Obsidian 1.4.5
- Fixed: Unexpected browser feature 'css-scrollbar' is only partially supported by Obsidian 1.4.5
- Fixed: This assertion is unnecessary since it does not change the type of the expression.
- Fixed: This assertion is unnecessary since the receiver accepts the original type of the expression.
- Fixed: Use 'activeDocument' instead of 'document' for popout window compatibility.
- Fixed: Removed all 'as any' type declarations
- Fixed: Removed extraneous !important declarations
- Added: ESLint CI blockers for future commits on the above fixes

## 2.4.1 - July 2, 2026

### Features

Added collapsible headers when viewing feeds in "feed" grouping ([GH Issue #149](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/149))

### Plugin Compliance

- Upon submission of 2.4.0, the plugin was flagged with 455 issues found by automated scans. The [2.4.0 audit remediation plan](docs/archive/investigations/2026/2.4.0-audit/2.4.0_audit_remediation_plan.md) was proposed and implemented. The !important warnings all have comments explaining their usage.
- Additional CI/commit blockers were added to the repo which will disallow future commits that violate eslint rules in order to remain compliant

## 2.4.0 - July 1, 2026

#### Multi-select sidebar folders

- Added ability to control+click and shift+click select multiple folders in the sidebar. This allows you to filter and view only the articles contained within those folders.

### Fixes

- Fixed 'custom' input textbox not being hidden when changing between different timeframes in add/edit feed modal ([GH Issue #147](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/147))
- Fixed feeds not being refreshed after deleting all feeds via feed manager modal
- Fixed a bug where a single slow or unresponsive feed fetch could block the rest of the feeds from refreshing or completing an OPML import

## 2.4.0-beta.3 - June 17, 2026

### Features

#### Auto-tag via Folder

- You may now apply multiple auto-tags to articles based upon the sidebar folder they are stored in. This feature is available in the sidebar via right click -> Auto-tag feeds in folder.. You may also target subfolders and may choose to apply tags to all current articles or only future articles.
- 'Sync folder auto-tags' option adds newly selected folder tags where missing, and remove tag names you deselected from this folder's rule. Other tags (manual tags, per-feed tags, parent folder tags not removed here) are left unchanged.
- Remove all tags — strip every tag from existing articles in the selected scope, including manual tags and tags from other rules.-
- This adds to the already existing "auto-tag by feed source" feature introduced in 2.4.0-beta.2. A full guide on all the tagging options are available: [docs/tags-primer.md](docs/tags-primer.md)

#### Shard Storage version 2 (v2)

- Added Shard Storage mode v2 to improve sync reliability across devices. This mode introduces a new user-state.json file alongside data.json, which stores per-article state — read/unread, favorited, saved, tags, and play progress. Feed shard files now contain only article content and the GUID used to link back to user-state.json. data.json now stores only plugin settings.
- This separation resolves race conditions that previously caused some sync tools (e.g. Remotely Save, WebDAV-based sync) to overwrite read/star/tag changes when a feed refresh on another device landed at the same time.
- v2 is opt-in: existing users on legacy or v1 storage can migrate via the new "Vault location (v2 — split user state)" option in the Storage settings tab. A confirmation prompt explains the change before migration runs.
- updated [docs/storage-vault-shards-guide.md](docs/storage-vault-shards-guide.md) to include v2 documentation and comparison of all 3 existing storage modes.

#### Sidebar feed fetch status

- Added a new red (!) icon adjacent to the unread badge which indicates a feed that failed to fetch. Hovering over the icon or right clicking the feed and selecting "View fetch error" will show the reason for the fetch failure. Long-press on mobile/tablet will also open the same right-click context menu.
- Added a new toggle setting in Sidebar tab to enable/disable the feed fetch status icon.

#### Autoproxies

- Added a new Auto setting to the Proxy dropdown in General Settings which cycles through the list of all proxies instead of only being allowed to choose one. This setting is enabled on by default.

#### Auto-refresh

- Added: configurable startup refresh delay (in seconds, default 5). This can be adjusted to reduce processing load upon startup.

### Fixes

- Fixed some feeds not properly rendering card previews (e.g. [World History Encyclopedia](https://www.worldhistory.org/rss/))
- Fixed laggy feeds (NPR)
- Fixed preview image not appearing in cards for feeds that don't have an image url provided.
- Fixed cards showing a blank gray card instead of just summary text, due to interpreting pixel tracker as the image.
- Fixed date inside card toolbar misalignment
- Fixed some feeds like TED Talks not properly showing summary text inside cards.
- Fixed mobile sidebar tags issue where tapping checked rows were unable to be unchecked.
- Fixed inline viewer not rendering reader toolbar
- Fixed some sidebar icons not properly rendering
- Fixed 'All Feeds' spinner not spinning on mobile/tablet when refreshing all feeds
- Fixed some broken favicons causing unnecessary internal code loops while trying to resolve

## 2.4.0-beta.2 - June 9, 2026

### New Features

#### Auto Tagging

- Added three ways to auto-tag articles: by feed source, by individual feed, and by folder. Tags can be combined, with folders cascading to descendant feeds.
- **Feed source**: Added to `Settings > Tags > Auto Tagging` - you can now enable multi-tag auto-tagging based on the feed source (for example, apply "RSS" to all RSS feeds, or "YouTube" to all YouTube feeds, or apply your own custom tags).
- **Individual feed**: Added a new "Custom auto-tags" dropdown in the Add/Edit feed window under the existing "Feed options" dropdown:

  - If feed-source auto-tags are enabled for that feed (via Settings), the individual feed tags are applied on top of the feed-source tags.
  - For example, if you have enabled feed-source auto-tags and applied "RSS" to all RSS feeds, and you also apply the individual feed tag "News" to that feed, all articles from that feed will be tagged with both "RSS" and "News".
  - If no feed-source auto-tags are configured, only the individual feed tags apply.
- Within the Edit feed window, the "Feed options" dropdown now shows a section for inherited feed-source auto-tags where applicable.
- **Folder auto-tags**: Right-click any folder in the sidebar and choose **Auto tag feeds in folder...** to assign tags that cascade to all feeds in that folder and its descendants. Tags are stored on the configured folder only; child folders inherit parent tags dynamically. Use **Existing articles** to sync folder auto-tags to stored articles (adds new rule tags and removes deselected rule tags while leaving other tags intact) or remove all tags in scope. See [docs/tags-primer.md](docs/tags-primer.md) for precedence and examples.

#### Podcast Player

- Added: Setting > Media > Podcast player setting where users can apply a default play speed that automatically applies when the player loads an episode.
- Added: "Autoplay" button in the playlist bar. Enabling it will autoplay episodes when the previous one finishes. Disabling it will only play the current episode and will prevent episodes from automatically playing.

### Fixes

- Fixed RSS feed profile favicon size overflow on Android devices where favicons in the sidebar were rendering at massive sizes instead of the intended 16x16px. Added explicit `max-width`, `max-height`, and touch-device CSS constraints for profile image icons (used by Mastodon feeds) to prevent uncontrolled scaling on mobile WebView browsers.
- Fixed a bug within 2.4.0-beta.1 which was writing unnecessary amounts of data to the JSON files causing performance degradation

### Changes

- Added two new settings tabs, 'Storage' and 'Sidebar'. These are refactors of already existing features contained elsewhere in the settings, but moved into their own dedicated tabs to improve the user experience.

## [2.4.0-beta.1] - June 5, 2026

### New Features

- Added Settings > General > Saved article open location option to control where saved articles open. [GH FR #131](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/131)
- Added ',' keybind to mark article read and advance to next article. [GH FR #183](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/138)
- Added Obsidian URI support for one-click feed subscription via `obsidian://rss-dashboard?action=add-feed&url=<encoded-feed-url>`, including parameter validation and unsupported-action notices. [GH FR #126](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/126)
- Added {{image}} to Article Saving template which includes URL to cover image if it exists [GH FR #128](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/128)

### Fixes

#### Saving articles to vault not saving article content

- [GH Issue #127](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/127) - appeared to be the same issue on the surface but turned out to be several:
- Certain feeds with malformed xml would corrupt the saved article. Added a new cleaner helper to sanitize the feed xml. [beehiiv.com example](https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/40ZQ7CSldT.xml)
- Certain feeds (i.e. Substack) would not save articles or images properly when saving article to vault due to Substack's content:encoded xml schema and our parsing helper not handling it properly.
- Fixed format discrepency between saving article via dashboard card and saving article via reader toolbar (different pathways interally but now both resolve the same way for the user's saved note)

#### Cross-platform sync reliability

- Added a new bootstrap pointer which saves metadata config locally so the app knows where to look upon restart.
- Changed default storage type for fresh plugin installs from Legacy JSON to Shard Storage - still retaining Legacy JSON as an option to ease transition for existing users.
- Resolves [GH Issue #142](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/142) and [GH Issue #140](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/140)
- Added a variable-length sync nonce (\_syncNonce + \_syncPad) to every saveData call, ensuring the file size changes on each write so Obsidian Sync reliably detects and uploads settings changes. When small changes were made that left data.json filesize unaffected, sync became unreliable. This hash appends a random string to the end of data.json between 1-2kb so data.json will always be different on each save.
- Added comprehensive step-by-step instructions for ensuring successful cross-platform sync of RSS Dashboard settings and data to [README.md ## Syncing Across Devices](README.md)

### Community Plugin Audit

- Remediation work on latest Community Plugin Audit (https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/rss-dashboard) - now standing at 72% compliance (up from 46% last version).
- **Dynamic `<script>` element creation**

  - Flagged as a red/critical risk due to 2.3.0's media progress saving feature (specifically Youtube iFrame embeds)
  - Rewrote how the progress is stored that adheres to Obsidian's best practices and Youtube SDK API
  - Added CI/CD ESLint rule to prevent dynamic `<script>` element creation in the future
- Completely eliminated all Node.js/Electron `fs` and `path` usages from the production plugin code
- Completely eliminated all superflous !important declarations; added comments to remaining declarations that pass audit and deemed necessary

## [2.3.0] - May 26, 2026

- Official Release. No additional changes added since 2.3.0-beta.3. See [docs/releases/2.3.0.md](docs/releases/2.3.0.md) for complete release notes.

## [2.3.0-beta.3] - May 19, 2026

### Features

#### New: Keyboard Shortcuts

- Implemented a new comprehensive keyboard shortcuts system to enhance navigation and productivity.
- To quickly access the keyboard shortcuts help file, press `?` (Shift + /) within the app. This will display a list of available shortcuts and their functions.

#### Playback Progress

- Added a new **Settings > Media > Remember Playback Progress** toggle to automatically save and restore podcast and video playback position across reader and plugin restarts.
- Additional information can be found within the ## Media Playback Progress Tracking section of [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) guide and assures users that all data is stored locally and no telemetry is collected .

#### Twitter/X/Nitter default folder

- Added Settings > Media > Twitter/X/Nitter default folder to specify a default folder for Twitter/X/Nitter feeds. This folder is auto-detected and suggested after user adds a Twitter/X/Nitter feed.

### Fixes

- Fixed Reader view article bodies disappearing for rich feed HTML on affected feeds such as Ars Technica and Substack.
- Fixed URLs ending in x mistakenly interpreting as x/nitter feeds [GH Issue #121 submitted by Wiloti](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/121)

## [2.3.0-beta.2] - May 15, 2026

### Features

- Added configurable metadata `data.json` location with dedicated migration controls and backup/import-export support. See: [docs/storage-vault-shards-guide.md](docs/storage-vault-shards-guide.md).
- Fixed Bloomberg-style video feed items being misclassified as restricted articles by improving media type detection (including image-first `media:content` handling and conservative video-route fallback), and added regression coverage for parser, media classification, reader surfaces, and save flow to prevent false paywall notices/banners.
- Added paywall/restricted-content detection so the Reader shows a banner when only excerpted content is available.
- Added automatic `Video` tagging for detected non-YouTube video items, plus a new **Settings > Media > Auto-tag videos** toggle (enabled by default). Existing users are migrated/backfilled safely.
- Added long-press support on folders in sidebar for mobile devices that performs the same right-click functionality as desktop. Resolves [GH Issue #113](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/113)
- Added new status section in edit feed modal to show location of feed ID, feed storage type (shard or legacy), and a copy button to quickly copy the local location.
- Added "URL" as a Rule target alongside title, summary, and content which allows filters based upon URL address (i.e. 'shorts' for YouTube Shorts) [GH PR #116 submitted by Caleb68864](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/pull/116)
- Added new Display setting to change from Relative timestamps (Today, 1 day ago, 1 week ago etc) to Absolute timestamps (e.g. May 15, 2026) [GH Issue #115 submitted by Thehone1](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/115)

### Fixes

- Fixed bug where reverting from 'shard' storage back to 'legacy' caused all articles to become marked as past auto-deletion date.
- Fixed YouTube feed articles duplicating in shard storage when the same video was stored under different GUID forms (`yt:video:VIDEO_ID`, `watch?v=VIDEO_ID`, `/shorts/VIDEO_ID`). All three forms now normalize to a single canonical key so duplicates are prevented on refresh and existing duplicate pairs are auto-cleaned on load.

### Development

- **Compliance Audit: 45% → 100% Complete** ✅

  - Completed all items on the Obsidian Community Plugin audit scorecard.
  - Resolved all 37 "Disabling '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any'" occurrences by adding descriptive audit guardrail comments throughout the codebase.
  - Eliminated all unsafe `innerHTML` assignments in production rendering paths (replaced with `sanitizeAndAppendHtml`).
  - Migrated all global DOM API references to Obsidian's scoped `activeWindow` and `activeDocument` contexts (100+ occurrences) for popout window compatibility.
  - Replaced third-party `builtin-modules` dependency with native `module.builtinModules`.
  - Removed all deprecated Clipboard API fallbacks.
  - Final validation: ESLint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings), 130/130 test files passing (1180 tests).
  - See: [docs/plugin-scorecard.md](docs/plugin-scorecard.md)
- Relaxed eslint.config.mjs to now include testing files.
- Completed full burn-down of test-file ESLint backlog (2686 errors → 0 errors across 130 test files).
- Resolved all type-safety debt in test suite with boundary-cast pattern and strict interface definitions.
- Aligned `Notice` stub behavior with modern Obsidian API to resolve 21 unit test regressions.
- Added a new `Compliance Declarations (Audit Guardrails)` policy section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` with required pre-PR compliance checks.
- Added `docs/development/compliance-patterns.md` as the canonical implementation reference for audit-sensitive patterns (safe HTML rendering, boundary typing, popout-safe APIs, and DOM helper conventions).
- Added root `.instructions.md` and linked policy references in README/development docs/scorecard so AI-assisted and human contributions follow the same compliance guardrails.
- See: [docs/development/test-lint-backlog-tracker.md](docs/development/test-lint-backlog-tracker.md) for detailed test-file lint debt burn-down progress (54 passes, 2686 → 0 errors).

## [2.3.0-beta.1] - May 11, 2026

- New **Vault Shards storage mode**: Store article history in separate per-feed files instead of one large data.json file, with easy migration between modes.
- Enhanced storage controls: Manage storage mode, repair shards, and import/export data directly from General settings.
- Added a user-facing setup and FAQ guide for Vault Shards storage: [docs/storage-vault-shards-guide.md](docs/storage-vault-shards-guide.md).

## [2.2.0] - May 9, 2026

### Fixes (Patch)

- Dashboard article-state handling is now consistent across reader navigation, filter messaging, and per-feed retention updates: selected cards stay anchored below the sticky header after split/sidebar reader opens or layout changes; empty states now explain when articles are hidden by view filters, unread/read special views, age thresholds, or retention windows instead of falling back to a generic “No articles found”; and per-feed auto-delete duration changes now refresh and re-apply retention deterministically when toggled off/on or tightened, preventing old items from lingering or reappearing incorrectly.

### Features

- **"Add All" Button added to Discover page**

  - Added a new "Add All" button to the Discover page header. This button adds all feeds from the current page to the user's feed list.
- **Sort feeds by unread count**

  - Added a new option to the 'Sort' icon which organizes feeds by unread count.
  - Two options: High to Low / Low to High
- Added new "inline" reader view option to the general settings which opens the article in the same tab as the dashboard. (GH[#100](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/100))
- Added a new "external browser" reader view location option in General settings so article and media opens can bypass the in-app reader and launch in the system browser. (GH[#89](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/89))
- **Flexible Date Formatting for Templates** (GH[#102](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/102)):

  - Added support for custom date formats in article templates using Moment.js.
  - New variables: `{{dateShort}}` (renders as `YYYY-MM-DD`) and parameterized `{{date:FORMAT}}` (e.g., `{{date:YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm}}`).
  - Improved settings UI for Article Saving with a readable, row-by-row guide of all available template variables.
  - Full backward compatibility for `{{date}}`, `{{isoDate}}`, and `{{isoDateTime}}`.

### Fixes

- Fixed badge color settings not syncing between color picker and hex input controls. Color picker now updates hex input immediately, and hex input now updates color picker after validation.
- Fixed a bug where the Obsidian tab title was not properly updating when switching between feeds.
- Per-feed Add/Edit Feed options now support a separate Auto-refresh "Off" override in addition to "Use global setting", and the explicit Off state is preserved when adding or importing feeds.
- Multi-feed refreshes now run through a bounded worker pool of 4 with a 15s per-feed timeout, keep runtime-only refresh state per URL, merge refreshed feeds back into settings during the run, and finish with one save plus a final dashboard refresh. Single-feed refresh stays on the lightweight direct path. (Old behavior: all feeds were being refreshed individually with no indication of progress or completion)
- Fixed Reader View Location So It Controls Article Opening into sidebars (GH[#100](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/100))
- Fixed Discover and Smallweb views incorrectly opening in the sidebar when Dashboard view location was set to a sidebar option; they now always open as a new tab in the main content area.
- Adding a feed as "Favorite" now also applies the "Favorite" tag and is removed when un-favorited.
- Fixed reader tag pills so tag colors now render correctly in Reader view instead of showing plain text with no colored background.
- Fixed tag color edits so Reader view now refreshes its open tag DOM immediately after popover/settings color changes, matching the existing dashboard tag refresh behavior without needing to reopen the article.
- Fixed podcast feeds that only expose channel-level artwork so shared feed artwork now appears correctly in podcast episodes and the player instead of being dropped during parsing/refresh.
- Fixed the Manage Feeds workflow so the modal now closes after the user initiates an OPML import instead of remaining open behind the import flow.
- Saved articles now persist across vault reloads (PR#106)
- Saved articles no longer truncate title names

### Improvements

- Optimized the feed refresh process to reduce unnecessary network requests.
- Added a per-feed "Exclude from refresh" option in Add/Edit Feed so selected feeds can be skipped by auto-refresh and bulk refresh actions while still allowing direct manual refresh.

## [2.2.0-beta.10] - April 2, 2026

### New Features

- **Sidebar Toolbar Divider**:

  - Decoupled the vertical divider from the discover icon - now a standalone, configurable element.
  - Added "Divider" to the icon visibility settings in Display tab.
  - The divider can now be enabled/disabled and reordered among other icons via drag-and-drop.
  - Default position is between Discover and Add Feed icons.
- **Smart Auto-Refresh on Vault Open**:

  - Feeds now automatically refresh when opening the vault if the configured refresh interval has elapsed since the last refresh.
  - **Before:** The refresh timer reset to zero each time Obsidian closed. Users had to manually refresh or wait for the interval to pass after reopening the vault.
  - **After:** The plugin now tracks the last refresh timestamp in settings. On vault open, it checks if enough time has passed and refreshes immediately if needed.
  - Manual refreshes (sidebar icon, right-click menu, header button) also update the timestamp.
  - Respects all existing refresh interval settings (5 min to 24 hours).
- **Auto Refresh: Off Option added**

  - Added a new "Off" option to the refresh interval dropdown in General > Global Feeds > Refresh Interval. Resolves GH Issue #92
- **Mark Page Read button added**

  - Appears at the bottom of the article list
  - Marks only the articles from the current page as read, but leaves remaining articles in the feed untouched.

### Fixes

- Android bug causing list and card views to regress after every open
- New feeds now reliably preserve the current global max item default when added, instead of inheriting a lower retained-item limit if parser output omits the per-feed override.
- Chevron clicks in sidebar now only toggle collapse - GH[#91](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/91)
- Auto-deleted items no longer reappearing as unread upon refresh (PR#87 submitted by emiraga)
- Fixed fresh-install startup auto-refresh from showing a “Refreshing 0 feeds” toast or failing before the feed parser initializes.

### Development

- **Testing Baseline for 2.2.0**:
  - Established the first durable repo-wide automated test baseline for the plugin.
  - The pre-testing reference point was `2.1.9`, which effectively shipped without a meaningful unit test suite beyond minimal Vitest scaffolding.
  - The repo now has **110 passing test files** and **820 passing tests**.
  - Global coverage baseline is now **51.72% statements**, **41.04% branches**, **46.12% functions**, and **52.73% lines**.
  - Added broad unit and integration-style coverage across core services, views, components, settings flows, modals, and plugin lifecycle behavior.
  - Added and expanded shared test infrastructure including Obsidian API stubs, JSDOM polyfills, and purpose-built harnesses for complex UI/service surfaces.
  - Coverage thresholds are now actively enforced in `vitest.config.mjs` at **lines 40 / branches 33 / functions 34** to prevent regression.
  - Added contributor-facing testing documentation and archived the phase-by-phase handoff artifacts used during the coverage push.

## [2.2.0-beta.9] - March 27, 2026

### New Features

- **Sidebar Horizontal Scrolling**:

  - Added support for horizontal scrolling in the sidebar header toolbar via the mouse scrollwheel.
  - Added click-and-drag horizontal scrolling for desktop and mobile touch devices.
  - Added "grabbing" cursor feedback and touch-drag optimization to prevent accidental icon clicks while scrolling.
- **XML support**: Import OPML window now allows XML filenames in addition to OPML filenames.
- **Feed View**:

  - Added a new "Feed" view mode for a social-media-style, single-column layout.
  - Features hero images, clamped text summaries, and integrated action toolbars.
  - Added a 3-button view toggle (List, Card, Feed) to the hamburger menu using the accessible `clickable-icon` pattern.
  - Added "Feed" view as a preference in General settings.
  - Improved Feed View image quality by prioritizing high-resolution images and implementing a "hero blur" background layout to handle varying aspect ratios gracefully.
  - Refactored the hamburger menu view toggle from individual buttons into a single consolidated dropdown menu with dynamic icons and enhanced theme compatibility for both dark and light modes.
- **Auto-backup**: Added auto-backup for data.json, OPML, and userdata on plugin unload. By default, OPML and userdata are backed up to the plugin's data directory. These can be changed in the import/export settings.

### Fixes

- **Pagination**: Fixed a bug where the Dashboard would bypass pagination limits and display all articles when toggling view filters or switching to the "Unread" sidebar view.
- **Scroll Restoration**: Fixed a bug where the Dashboard would reset to the top when opening the Reader panel or resizing the window; implemented a focus-locking mechanism to keep the selected article in view.
- **Auto-delete bug**: Fixed a bug where imported feeds were not respecting the global default auto-delete duration.

### Development

- **Refactor article-list.ts**: Refactored article-list.ts monolith - extracted the filter menu and hamburger menu into separate components.

## [2.2.0-beta.8] - March 24, 2026

- **IMPORTANT**: Earlier limited releases intended for users experiencing specific issues were tagged as 2.3.0-alpha.1, 2.3.0-alpha.2, and 2.3.0-alpha.3. These were incorrectly versioned. They have been retroactively designated as 2.2.0-beta.5, 2.2.0-beta.6, and 2.2.0-beta.7 in our internal documentation. The original GitHub release tags have been left intact to avoid breaking any shared links. Development continues from 2.2.0-beta.8 forward.

### New Features

- **Customizable sidebar ordering (drag-and-drop)**:

  - Drag feeds to reorder within a folder (or move + insert between feeds).
  - Drag folders to reorder, and drag onto another folder to nest/un-nest (supports hierarchical organization).
  - Any manual reorder automatically switches the sidebar sort mode to a new **Custom** row to preserve your ordering.
- **Customizable sidebar toolbar icons**:

  - New setting: `Settings > Display > Icon visibility`.
  - Drag-and-drop or up/down buttons (mobile friendly).
  - Hide/show individual icons.
  - Hide/show entire toolbar.
  - New sidebar toolbar "settings" button (opens RSS-Dashboard settings).
- **Sidebar Tag Filtering**:

  - Revamped **Tags** section in the sidebar for easy management and improved filtering logic: **AND** (match all), **OR** (match any), and **NOT** (match none).
  - Inline **Add Tag** row with color picker integrated directly into the sidebar.
- **Podcast Player Sleep Timer**: Added a sleep timer to the podcast player to automatically stop playback after a specified duration (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, or 120 minutes) (GitHub issue #75).
- **Podcast "Open in Browser" improvements**:

  - Fixed the toolbar button, which was previously non-functioning.
  - The button now attempts to resolve the podcast’s website URL from feed metadata, falling back to the podcast’s RSS feed URL if no website URL is found.
  - The dropdown now includes URLs found in the "Episode details" section of the podcast page, plus a link to the direct audio file.
- **Pocket Casts Support**: Added support for importing podcasts directly from Pocket Casts URLs (e.g., `https://pocketcasts.com/podcast/...`).
- **Robust Podcast Resolution**:

  - Implemented a multi-proxy fallback system (AllOrigins, CodeTabs) to handle network timeouts and CORS restrictions when resolving podcast feeds.
  - Added a "Semantic Discovery" fallback using the **iTunes Search API** to resolve feeds when Pocket Casts hides the RSS link from their web player source.
  - Added flexible metadata scraping to handle varied HTML attribute ordering in modern web layouts.
- **Proactive Proxy Validation**: The Add Feed and Edit Feed modals now check whether the CORS proxy is enabled before attempting to resolve Pocket Casts URLs, providing a clear warning and guidance if it’s disabled.
- **OPML Import Menu Overhaul**: The OPML import menu has been completely overhauled to improve reliability and user experience.
- **View Filter Setting Improvements**:

  - All applied view filters now persist across navigation (state is saved and restored on reopen/restart).
  - All applied view filters now explicitly state which ones are currently applied in the dashboard header.
  - Updated `Settings > Display > Startup filters` to mirror the dashboard filter UI, allowing multiple viewing filters to be applied at startup.

### Fixed

- **Reader tags menu**: Reader toolbar now uses the same tag management portal UI as dashboard cards (edit/delete/add tags, mobile sheet support).
- **Reader save button**: The save button icon in the reader now appropriately turns purple when saved and changes its tooltip to "Click to open saved article". Clicking it in this state will directly open the saved markdown file in your vault, mirroring the dashboard functionality. Also updated the "custom folder location" option to suggest folders based on your vault structure, with proper text validation that adheres to Obsidian’s folder naming conventions.
- **Reader Nitter rendering**: Improved X/Twitter (Nitter) feed items in Reader view with a compact author/handle/date title, a single formatted tweet body (no "Feed description" callout), and a compact stats icon row when present. Article titles no longer show the entire tweet and instead show the author, handle, and date.
- **Obsidian Properties UI compatibility**: Fixed a critical issue where enabling the plugin could cause vault-wide Properties "type mismatch" error indicators due to unscoped global CSS overrides.
- **Settings migration (Filters → Rules)**: The global `filters` setting has been renamed to `rules` to avoid confusion with viewing filters. The new implementation is backwards compatible with existing beta users’ settings via a one-time migration.
- **Article dedupe bug** Fixed duplicate articles for feeds (e.g. BBC) where item GUIDs can change between refreshes via numeric URL fragments (`#0`, `#1`, ...); existing stored duplicates are auto-deduped on load.
- **Pagination**: Fixed pagination controls not updating when switching between views. Added new 'All' option to page size dropdowns. Adjusting the pagination at the bottom of the page now sychronizes with the pagination controls in settings (General > Results shown per page).

### Development

- **Developer Documentation**: Added a new "Advanced Podcast Platform Resolution" section to the developer docs describing proxy rotation and semantic search patterns.
- **CSS Guardrail**: Added `npm run check:css-scope` (runs during `npm run build`) to prevent unscoped CSS rules from targeting Obsidian core selectors (e.g., `.clickable-icon`, `.suggestion-container`, `.hidden`).
- **Settings Architecture Refactor**:

  - Refactored the monolithic settings tab into a modular architecture for maintainability and performance.
  - Split settings rendering into 9 dedicated tab renderer modules.
  - Centralized shared settings modal classes.
  - Isolated pure tab-name helpers to enable zero-dependency unit testing.
  - Used TDD-driven logic for color normalization, icon reordering, and preset detection.
  - Added many new unit tests covering settings-related logic.
  - Reduced the main settings tab orchestrator to ~119 lines.
- **Feed manager refactor**:

  - Reorganized the feed manager modal code to be more modular and maintainable (kept backwards compatibility for now; planned for deprecation in the next major release).
  - UI: standardized “supported formats” badges using Lucide icons.
  - Folder handling: improved folder-path collection and removed duplicate folder traversal across folder pickers and the sidebar.
  - Fix: corrected nested folder deletion behavior.
  - Tests: expanded unit coverage across feed manager behavior, sidebar “Add Feed” opening, folder-path utilities, preview loading, and nested folder removal.
- **ReaderView Refactor**: Extracted the reader format settings portal into a helper, added ReaderView cleanup on close, and added unit coverage.

## [2.3.0-alpha.3 / 2.2.0-beta.7] - March 18, 2026

### New Features

- **Sidebar Feed Filtering** (github issue #74): Added a new setting "Hide empty feeds/no unread articles" to automatically hide feeds with zero articles or only read articles from the sidebar.
- **Standardized Icon Rendering**:

  - Refactored all interactive icons to use the Obsidian-recommended `clickable-icon` pattern.
  - Replaced standard HTML `<button>` elements with accessible `div` structures for better cross-platform (Android) compatibility.
  - Added full keyboard support (Enter/Space) to all interactive icons.
  - Centralized icon sizing via the `--icon-size` CSS variable.
- **Reader Settings Refactor**:

  - Touch sliders not ideal for mobile devices due to base Obsidian touch behavior, replaced with dropdowns to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.
    - Replaced "Words per row" slider with a percentage-based "Paragraph width" dropdown (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).
    - Replaced "Font size" slider with a discrete dropdown (80% to 200%).
    - Replaced "Line height" slider with a discrete dropdown (100% to 200%).
  - Added 2px horizontal padding for 100% paragraph width to improve readability.

### Fixed

- **YouTube Feed Discovery** (github issue #77): Fixed an issue where adding certain YouTube channels would return the wrong RSS feed by prioritizing metadata tags (`rel="canonical"` and `itemprop="channelId"`) over generic page content.
- **Android/iOS Rendering**: Fixed multiple instances where icons failed to render or appeared broken on mobile devices.
- **iOS Feed Content**:
  - Fixed an issue where Substack and Psychology Today articles appeared empty on iPhone by implementing robust XML namespace extraction using `getElementsByTagNameNS` instead of `querySelector`.
  - Fixed full article content fetching (via Readability) failing on iOS for sites with strict WAFs (like Psychology Today) by introducing a tiered fetch mechanism with a configurable CORS Proxy fallback. You can now enable and configure a CORS proxy in the settings (see reference `docs/bugs/ios-full-article-fetch-failure.md`).
- **Reader Rendering** (discord issue): Improved article display logic to ensure content is always rendered as the primary body, even if it matches the feed description.
- **ESLint/Build Integrity**:
  - Cleaned up multiple ESLint & TypeScript compilation errors in `ReaderView`.
  - Implemented strictly-typed Obsidian app and plugin interfaces for safer API access.
  - Standardized `HighlightService` and `robustFetch` usage to match modern patterns.
- **Feed and Folder Validation** (github issue #67):
  - Added strict validation for forbidden characters (`[ ] # ^ | / \ : * " < > ?`) and leading dots in feed titles and folder names.
  - Integrated validation into Add Feed, Edit Feed, and Folder Rename modals to prevent data corruption and filesystem issues.
  - Improved `sanitizeName` logic to provide better defaults during automated imports (e.g., OPML).

### Development

- **Testing**: Added unit tests for namespaced XML extraction and reader logic in `test_files/unit/ios-namespace-fix.test.ts`.
- **Build Logging**: Added explicit confirmation messages to `esbuild.config.mjs` to verify successful JS and CSS bundling.
- **Removed**
  - **YouTube Short Detection**: removed feature introduced in 2.3.0-alpha.1 due to inconsistent tagging. Added a comprehensive [bug report](docs/archive/investigations/2026/youtube-shorts-tagging-failure.md) for future reference.

## [2.3.0-alpha.2 / 2.2.0-beta.6] - March 16, 2026

### New Features

  - **UI** - Refreshed in-app podcast player layout and controls.
  - **Episode Details**: Added a collapsible "Episode details" section under the seek bar showing episode metadata and sanitized show notes (from parsed feed content).
  - **Podcast Tags**: Show episode tags in the player and in playlist rows (with overflow handling).
- **Export Settings**: Added copy-to-clipboard actions for Settings exports (data.json, usersettings.json, OPML)
- **Global Feed Settings**: Added a global feed settings in General tab to set default values for new feeds

### Fixed

- Fixed some feeds losing older history (often collapsing to ~25 items) after refresh; refresh now preserves previously cached items outside the server “latest N” window and applies per-feed retention deterministically.
- Per-feed options now always show when adding a new feed (collapsed by default, follows default global feed settings)
- Podcast player now keeps play/pause button state in sync during autoplay
- Sorting/shuffling the podcast playlist no longer interrupts playback
- Switching episodes via the playlist no longer auto-plays unexpectedly
- Article title in reader now hidden on mobile view
- Reader settings sheet now notch-safe on iPhone, with improved touch layout, slider sizing, and a bottom “Done” CTA
- Card/List view: Article titles no longer reserve an empty second line for short titles; titles now clamp to 2 lines with truncation.
